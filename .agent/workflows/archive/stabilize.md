description: Mid-Task Stabilization Summary
---
Use this workflow when the current task is drifting, context is bloated, or you need to checkpoint your progress before continuing (potentially in a new chat).

1. Pause execution.
2. Create a **MID-TASK STABILIZATION SUMMARY** with the following structure (verbatim):

   **1. CURRENT GOAL**
   - What we are trying to achieve right now (1–2 sentences)

   **2. CONFIRMED FACTS**
   - Things we verified as true (no speculation)

   **3. INVALIDATED HYPOTHESES**
   - Approaches tried that did NOT work and why

   **4. CURRENT STATE OF THE CODE / SYSTEM**
   - What exists now and what condition it’s in

   **5. CONSTRAINTS & NON-GOALS**
   - Things we must not change or assumptions we must keep

   **6. MOST LIKELY NEXT STEPS**
   - 2–4 concrete actions, in order

   **7. OPEN QUESTIONS**
   - What is still unknown or ambiguous

3. Ensure the summary is concise but precise.
4. Do NOT propose new ideas beyond the next steps.
5. Do NOT rewrite history.
