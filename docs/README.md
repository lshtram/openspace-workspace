# OpenSpace Docs

This documentation set is intentionally minimal.

Status: canonical docs only.

## Canonical Documents

- Architecture: `docs/architecture/TECHSPEC-MODALITY-PLATFORM-V2.md`
- Requirements: `docs/requirements/REQ-MODALITY-PLATFORM-V2.md`
- Drawing V2 Reference: `openspace-client/docs/architecture/drawing-modality-implementation-guide-v2.md`

## Rule

Do not create parallel architecture or requirements guides.

Update the canonical docs in place.

## What To Execute

Follow the backlog in `docs/requirements/REQ-MODALITY-PLATFORM-V2.md` Section 11, in order.
