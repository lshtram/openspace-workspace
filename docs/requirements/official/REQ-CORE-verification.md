## Discrepancies Found
- Transcript storage has missing/empty message parts; summary verification treated these as empty/aborted messages for review.

## Reviewer Notes
Requirements were derived directly from the session summary. Summary updates added documentation execution insights and transcript storage constraints, which do not introduce new product requirements. Verification completed against the updated summary.

## Verification Signature
